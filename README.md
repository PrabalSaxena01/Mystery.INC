This is a basic shopping cart made using only JavaScript

No React no frameworks just vanilla JS and CSS

Product cards are created from a simple JavaScript data array

You can increase or decrease quantity with plus and minus buttons

Everything you add to cart is saved in localStorage automatically

The cart icon updates live with total items in your cart

Cart page shows items with image price and remove option

Total price is calculated and shown at the bottom of cart

Theres no real payment system just frontend stuff.
